# Implementation Tickets

This directory contains detailed implementation specifications for AI agents to execute independently.

## Purpose

Each ticket is a self-contained specification that provides:
- Clear objectives and acceptance criteria
- Relevant architectural context from main docs
- Complete code examples and patterns to follow
- Specific files to create/modify
- Expected behavior and edge cases

## Terminology

We use **"Implementation Tickets"** rather than "user stories" because:
- No point estimation or sprint planning needed (solo developer)
- Audience is AI agents, not human developers
- Focus on precise implementation specs, not abstract user needs
- Single-pass execution model (not iterative refinement)

## Ticket Structure

Each ticket follows this format:

1. **Overview** - What feature/component is being built
2. **Context** - Links to relevant architecture docs
3. **Objectives** - Clear, measurable goals
4. **Implementation Details** - Step-by-step with code examples
5. **Files to Create/Modify** - Exact file paths
6. **Acceptance Criteria** - How to verify completion
7. **Notes** - Design decisions, trade-offs, future considerations

## Naming Convention

Tickets are numbered sequentially and grouped by feature area:

```
001-character-gallery.md
002-character-profile.md
003-unlock-scanner.md
004-shop-mystery-boxes.md
...
```

## Workflow

1. **Create Ticket** - Document implementation details with code examples
2. **Review** - Human approval/refinement before execution
3. **Execute** - AI agent implements following specifications
4. **Verify** - Check against acceptance criteria
5. **Complete** - Mark ticket as done, move to next

## Status Tracking

- `[ ]` Not started
- `[IN PROGRESS]` Currently being implemented
- `[REVIEW]` Awaiting human review
- `[✓]` Completed

Status is tracked in each ticket's header.

**Note**: This is a pioneering approach to AI-assisted development. Structure will evolve based on what works best in practice.
